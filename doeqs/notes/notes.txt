Notes.
	//currently working on:
		//xhr login & logout - reloading?
		//textbox at side for taking random notes? Research bar? Spelling&pronunciation tools?
		//Admin [and team-captain] backend: changing assignments, looking through marked-as-bad questions (reversing credit for it), etc...?
		//Multiple-choice thingermabob
		//Download-options xhr: Make sure to make download date dynamic.
			//Date, team, format: ensure it's actually a full round
		//QSets

	//How well is it going to work once it's uploaded? Just import dbs and that's it?
	//provide easy copy-paste option for people who've stocked up already [and ability to upload *.doc(x) for old qs]
	//automatic email reminders? I think 000webhost can do that
	//Question-access menu
	//xhr download?
	//Main page with question-submit sub-page?
	//Cookies are rather easily forged, messing up the whole auth system. What are those login tokens anyway?
	//1366747200 is next Tues, for reference.
	//Are things being escaped too much? JS, PHP, SQL...
	//Streamline code, interface
	//Bug rept/comment page
	//Put in lots of comment documentation!
	//NEVER delete assignments! Then might not be able to access the questions they correspond to.=>fix this, due to nature of getTimestamps()
	//Upload and convert old rounds
	//Take regular backups of database...? To files? Export automatically?
	//Unescape once escaped
	//easy mc input
	//Given majors, GENERATE assignments on command of captain
	//Permissions - 0=admin, 1=teamcapt, 2=teammember
	//Client-side validation...
	//Login - on enter-key press - wrapping in <form> does it automatically
	//NEVER lose questions! autosave&backup in cookie, server, make sure confirm before close/logout/leave page, etc.
		//error handling=check with JS then if error on server side once submitted, echo the question and say there's an error.
	//What if want to do extra???=>submit as (without-TimestampDue-but-with-TimestampSubd) buffer to be selected from later as needed! [at the time of creation of a new duedate]
		//incentive program - extra points for extra questions, compiles into extra rounds
	//Editing questions?
	//SessionVer: will it work if I have a hashed something+name as key?
	//$_SESSION?
	//Store what's actually displayed on-site, i.e. "BIOLOGY "
	//Server: SHUFFLES the questions!!!! Can do lots of things. Generate rounds! (if there are enough... just stick with fixed-date rounds for now) (also - reading rounds, exclude (given) team's questions)
	//now, to display multiple questions on qsub page... can use question-wrapper.getElementById
	//keep logs?
	//Question-search page?
	//Homepage, etc.
	//Assignments...? Old code:
		//DECREMENT the required assignment.
		//$querydec="UPDATE assignments SET ".$qstuff[1]." = ".$qstuff[1]."-1";
		//$querydec.=" WHERE Name = \"".$qstuff[0]."\"";
		//$querydec.=" AND TimestampDue = ".$qstuff[8];//Wherever it's the right name and date (hopefully unique...) then decrement the subject requirement.
		//$con->query($querydec);
	//Filtering duplicate questions - if everything but id match up, delete all but one.
