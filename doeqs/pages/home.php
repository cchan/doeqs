Welcome to DOE Question Input.<br>
<br>
This site is currently in progress. If your computer dies (no idea how that could possibly happen but just saying) it ain't my fault.
<p>Please add any feature suggestions to the bug report box to the right of the screen. Please also report any bugs, in decent detail so I can actually find them. And please don't write anything that's obviously going to be put there eventually - yes, I <i>do</i> know that the "Round" page would be more useful if it could actually run a buzzer round. Thanks!</p>

Some general suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Occasionally problems may arise because your browser is storing old versions of important website files in its cache. Try force-reloading the page with ctrl+f5 in Windows, command+R in Mac, or f5 in Linux.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to poke around at the interface. If it fails, you've found a bug. Hooray. Enter it over there &gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>Don't actually go about destroying things with security bugs; that tends to be unpleasant.</li>
<li>Email me at <?php echo WEBMASTER_EMAIL;?> if you have questions, concerns, whatever.</li>
</ul>
